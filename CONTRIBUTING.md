Please review your PR does not modify anything that has impact on it. For example changing a Variable Name or adding a new one. 

## Pull Request Checklist

systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can
accept and merge it. If the pull request modifies anything, that could impact 
Terraform module (https://github.com/coralogix/terraform-coralogix-aws), necessary
PR needs to be created in module repository. For example, a new environment variable
is added.
We recommend that you check the following things locally
before you submit your code:
